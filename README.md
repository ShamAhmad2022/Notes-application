# Notes-App

A ReactJs app to create notes and handle them.
The original idea is from a video on Youtube and it had the following features:
- add note.
- delete note.

Then i added my own features:
- add a Title to the note.
- view the detail of the note.
- edit the title and the note.
- Toggle Layout button to toggle between the notes layout(Grid or flex).
- the edited note will show at first.
